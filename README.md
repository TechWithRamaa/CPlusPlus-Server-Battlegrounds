# CPlusPlus-Server-Battlegrounds

Welcome to the **Ctrl-Alt-Serve** repository! üéâ

This repository is a collection of **C++ servers and clients** for both Linux and Windows platforms, built to handle various use cases such as single-request handling, asynchronous communication, ever-running servers, and more. üñ•Ô∏è

## Project Structure

- **Single-Request-Server-Linux**
  - `single-request-server-linux`: A simple server that handles one request at a time.

- **Single-Request-Server-Windows**
  - `single-request-server-windows`: A Windows server using Winsock for handling single requests.

- **Client Programs**
  - `single-client-linux`: A simple client that communicates with a server.
  - `async-client-linux`: A client that sends asynchronous requests to the server.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPlusPlus-Server-Battlegrounds.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific server/client directory**:
   ```bash
   cd single-request-server-linux
   ```
3. **Build using CMake**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
    ```
4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   ./SingleRequestServer
   ```
5. **Contributions**:
  * Feel free to fork, create feature branches, and contribute your own C++ servers!
